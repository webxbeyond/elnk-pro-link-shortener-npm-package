We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

- Be respectful and inclusive. Harassment or discrimination is not tolerated.
- Be considerate and constructive. Critique ideas, not people.
- Be collaborative. Seek consensus and help others succeed.
- Be responsible. Share context, document decisions, and learn from mistakes.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please open a confidential issue or contact the maintainers.

Enforcement: Maintainers may warn, restrict, or remove participants for violations to keep the community safe and productive.

This code of conduct is inspired by common open-source guidelines and the spirit of the Contributor Covenant.
